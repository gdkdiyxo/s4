<p>Hello, and welcome to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use ("Terms"). The Terms you see below are important because they:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Outline your legal rights on Spotify</li> 
 <li>Explain the rights you give to us when you use Spotify</li> 
 <li>Describe the rules everyone needs to follow when using Spotify</li> 
 <li>Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Please read these Terms, our <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> and any other terms referenced in this document carefully. We hope you're sitting comfortably and listening to some great music.<br> Here we go...</p> 
<h2><a href="#1-introduction" id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</a></h2> 
<p>Thanks for choosing Spotify ("Spotify," "we," "us," "our"). Spotify provides personalized services with social and interactive features for streaming music and other content as well as other products and services that may be developed from time to time. By signing up or otherwise using any of these Spotify services, including all associated features and functionalities, websites and user interfaces, as well as all content and software applications associated with our services (collectively, the "Spotify Service" or "Service"), or accessing any music, videos or other content or material that is made available through the Service (the "Content") you are entering into a binding contract with Spotify USA Inc.</p> 
<p>Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the <a href="#20-entire-agreement">Entire Agreement</a> section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the "Agreements"). The Agreements include terms regarding <a href="#s2">future changes to the Agreements</a>, <a href="#15-export-control">export controls</a>, <a href="#s3-2">automatic renewals</a>, <a href="#18-limitation-and-time-for-filing">limitations of liability</a>, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/privacy-policy">privacy</a>, <a href="#2423-no-class-or-representative-proceedings-class-action-waiver">waiver of class actions</a>, and <a href="#242-arbitration-agreement">resolution of disputes by arbitration</a> instead of in court. If you wish to review the terms of the Agreements, the current effective version of the Agreements can be found on Spotify's website. You acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound by them. If you don't agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you may not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.</p> 
<p>In order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you need to (1) be 18 years or older, or be 13 years or older and have your parent or guardian's consent to the Agreements, (2) have the power to enter a binding contract with us and not be barred from doing so under any applicable laws, and (3) reside in the United States. You also promise that any registration information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.</p> 
<h2><a href="#2-changes-to-the-agreements" id="2-changes-to-the-agreements">2 Changes to the Agreements</a></h2> 
<p>Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we'll provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email. In some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate your account by <a href="https://support.spotify.com/contact-spotify-support/">contacting us</a>. If you received a Trial or a Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel the applicable Paid Subscription through such third party.</p> 
<h2><a href="#3-enjoying-spotify" id="3-enjoying-spotify">3 Enjoying Spotify</a></h2> 
<p>Here's some information about all the ways you can enjoy Spotify.</p> 
<h3><a href="#31-service-options" id="31-service-options">3.1 Service Options</a></h3> 
<p>You can find a description of our Service options on <a href="https://www.spotify.com/">our</a> website, and we will explain which Service options are available to you when you create a Spotify account. Certain options are provided to you free-of-charge. The Spotify Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the "Free Service." Other options require payment before you can access them (the "Paid Subscriptions"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services in conjunction with or through the Spotify Service. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans and promotional offerings at any time in accordance with these Terms.</p> 
<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users. We will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services. If you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service. Note that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.</p> 
<p>If you have purchased or received a code, gift card, pre-paid offer or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription ("Code"), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions. You may also purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party. In such cases, separate terms and conditions with such third party in addition to the Agreements may apply to your access to the Service.</p> 
<h3><a href="#32-trials" id="32-trials">3.2 Trials</a></h3> 
<p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a "Trial"). Spotify may determine your eligibility for a Trial, and withdraw or modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the extent permitted under applicable law.</p> 
<p>For some Trials, we'll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. By providing such details you agree that we may automatically begin charging you for the Paid Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial on a recurring monthly basis or another interval that we disclose to you in advance. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL BY <a href="https://support.spotify.com/contact-spotify-support/">CLICKING HERE</a> IF YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE TRIAL THROUGH SPOTIFY, OR IF YOU RECEIVED YOUR TRIAL THROUGH A THIRD PARTY, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY.</p> 
<h2><a href="#4-payments-and-cancellations" id="4-payments-and-cancellations">4 Payments and Cancellations</a></h2> 
<h3><a href="#41-billing" id="41-billing">4.1 Billing</a></h3> 
<p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by (1) paying a subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or (2) pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period ("Pre-Paid Period").</p> 
<p>Spotify may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.</p> 
<h3><a href="#42-renewal-cancellation" id="42-renewal-cancellation">4.2 Renewal; Cancellation</a></h3> 
<p>Unless your Paid Subscription has been purchased for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period by <a href="https://support.spotify.com/contact-spotify-support/">clicking here</a> if you purchased the Paid Subscription through Spotify, or if you purchased the Paid Subscription through a third party, by canceling the Paid Subscription through such third party. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods.</p> 
<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated in the Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Service. If you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, you must cancel directly with that third party.</p> 
<h2><a href="#5-using-our-service" id="5-using-our-service">5 Using our service</a></h2> 
<p>The Spotify Service and the Content are the property of Spotify or Spotify's licensors. We grant you limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make use of the Spotify Service, and limited, non-exclusive, revocable permission to make personal, non-commercial use of the Content (collectively, "Access"). This Access shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Spotify. You promise and agree that you are using the Spotify Service and Content for your own personal, non-commercial use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Spotify Service or the Content.</p> 
<p>The Spotify software applications and the Content are not sold or transferred to you, and Spotify and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Spotify software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, wearable devices, speakers and/or other devices ("Devices").</p> 
<p>All Spotify trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Spotify brand ("Spotify Brand Features") are the sole property of Spotify or its licensors. The Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Spotify Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.</p> 
<p>You agree to abide by our <a href="#9-user-guidelines">User guidelines</a> and not to use the Spotify Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements. Except for the rights expressly granted to you in the Agreements, Spotify grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Spotify Service or Content.</p> 
<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Spotify Service are made available to you under the relevant third party software library's license terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.</p> 
<h2><a href="#6-third-party-applications-and-devices" id="6-third-party-applications-and-devices">6 Third Party Applications and Devices</a></h2> 
<p>The Spotify Service is integrated with or may otherwise interact with third party applications, websites, and services ("Third Party Applications") and third party Devices to make the Spotify Service available to you. These Third Party Applications and Devices may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications and Devices will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies. You understand and agree that Spotify does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or Device or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications and Devices, nor does Spotify warrant the compatibility or continuing compatibility of the Third Party Applications and Devices with the Service.</p> 
<h2><a href="#7-user-generated-content" id="7-user-generated-content">7 User-Generated Content</a></h2> 
<p>Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist titles, descriptions and compilations, and/or other types of content) ("User Content"). For the avoidance of doubt, "User Content" includes any such content posted to the Spotify Support Community as well as any other part of the Spotify Service.</p> 
<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Spotify, (1) you own or have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Spotify as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements or any other rights set forth within the User guidelines, applicable law, or the intellectual property, publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Spotify or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from Spotify or such individual or entity.</p> 
<p>Spotify may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content. In all cases, Spotify reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including User Content that, in Spotify's sole discretion, violates the Agreements. Spotify may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party. Removal or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.</p> 
<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post. Spotify is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content. YOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST SPOTIFY RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SPOTIFY HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.</p> 
<h2><a href="#8-rights-you-grant-us" id="8-rights-you-grant-us">8 Rights you grant us</a></h2> 
<p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Spotify Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you, and (3) to allow our business partners to do the same. In any part of the Spotify Service, the Content you access, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Spotify's agreements with third parties. Some Content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g. podcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content. The Spotify Service makes such Content available to you unmodified.</p> 
<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Spotify in connection with the Spotify Service or Content ("Feedback"), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Spotify to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you. Feedback is considered a type of User Content.</p> 
<p>You grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide license to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g. perform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created. Aside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content. Where applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive and not enforce any "moral rights" or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.</p> 
<h2><a href="#9-user-guidelines" id="9-user-guidelines">9 User guidelines</a></h2> 
<p>Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same. We've established a few ground rules for you to follow when using the Service, to make sure Spotify stays enjoyable for everyone. You must follow these rules and should encourage other users to do the same.</p>

<h3><a href="#241-governing-law--jurisdiction" id="241-governing-law--jurisdiction">24.1 Governing Law / Jurisdiction</a></h3> 
<p>The Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims arising out of or in connection with them) are subject to the laws of the state of California, United States of America, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.<br> Further, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the Northern District of California to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with the Agreements (and any non-contractual disputes/claims relating to or arising in connection with them) and is not subject to mandatory arbitration under Section 24.2.1.</p> 
<h3><a href="#242-arbitration-agreement" id="242-arbitration-agreement">24.2 ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</a></h3> 
<p><em>This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.</em></p> 
<h4><a href="#2421-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration" id="2421-dispute-resolution-and-arbitration">24.2.1 Dispute resolution and arbitration</a></h4> 
<p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.</p> 
<h3><a href="#2422-exceptions" id="2422-exceptions">24.2.2 Exceptions</a></h3> 
<p>Notwithstanding the clause above (24.2.1), you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court or (2) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator. In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).</p> 
<h3><a href="#2423-no-class-or-representative-proceedings-class-action-waiver" id="2423-no-class-or-representative-proceedings-class-action-waiver">24.2.3 No Class Or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver</a></h3> 
<p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p> 
<h4><a href="#2424-arbitration-rules" id="2424-arbitration-rules">24.2.4 Arbitration rules</a></h4> 
<p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in force (the "AAA Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at <a href="https://adr.org/">adr.org</a>, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Spotify can also help put you in touch with the AAA.</p> 
<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.</p> 
<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee. Spotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p> 
<h4><a href="#2425-notice-process" id="2425-notice-process">24.2.5 Notice; Process</a></h4> 
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Spotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify's last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p> 
<h4><a href="#2426-enforceability" id="2426-enforceability">24.2.6 Enforceability</a></h4> 
<p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24.1 shall govern any claim in court arising out of or related to the Agreements.</p>
